AI-Powered Surveillance Camera
This project is an AI-driven surveillance system capable of recognizing faces in real time. It uses deep learning-based facial recognition techniques and is designed for applications in security, monitoring, and automation.

Features
Real-Time Face Recognition: Identifies and verifies individuals using AI algorithms.
MobileNet Model: Utilizes a pre-trained MobileNet model for efficient performance.
Scalable Design: Easily adaptable for multiple environments like offices, homes, or public spaces.
Image Storage: Stores captured images for future reference or logs.

OpenCV
NumPy
dlib
TensorFlow/Keras (if needed for advanced features)
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Powered_Surveillance_Camera.git  
cd AI-Powered_Surveillance_Camera  
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Place the images for recognition in the images folder.

Usage
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python facerecog.py  
The system will access your webcam or connected camera to perform real-time face recognition.

Captured frames and recognition logs will be stored locally.

Future Improvements
Integration with IoT devices for remote access.
Adding multiple face recognition support.
Enhancing accuracy with more advanced models like FaceNet or DeepFace.
